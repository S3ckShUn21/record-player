Mifare Classics have 1k of memory.
Split into 16 sectors.
Each sector has 4 blocks. (i.e. 64 total blocks)


Notes on spotify URI
====================
* the uri is ALWAYS prepended by the text "spotify:", so I will omit storing it to save on memory
* the string will start at block 28 (sector 7, block 0) and take the next 2 full blocks, ending in the null byte


Notes on raw JSON
=================
* This is what will allow for a little customization when querying the spotify api for the different endpoints
* The JSON will start @ block 32 and have 512 bytes that it can take up.
* It may not take the whole 512 bytes and will end in the null byte.
